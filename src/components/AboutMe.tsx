        <p>
          I reside in Lagos, Nigeria and I studied Architecture, a course that
          influenced my eye for details and design. I am fueled by my passion
          for understanding the nuances of modern technologies and I consider
          myself a "forever student," eager to both build on my academic
          foundations, and stays in tune with the latest web development
          strategies through continued coursework and professional development.
          I am also passionate about staying fit and i enjoy boxing for fun
          alongside playing football. I am currently working as a freelance
          developer and I am always interested in a challenge. Reach out to
